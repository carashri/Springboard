Such inference relies on theory largely developed from the 19th-Century onwards that is subject to certain assumptions or theoretical limits. These are fine if those assumptions hold for the particular case you're working on, and what you want to do has a known theoretical distribution (for example the mean of a sampling distribution that we looked at in the previous mini-project.)"
